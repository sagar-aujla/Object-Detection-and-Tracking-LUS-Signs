# YOLOv4 + DeepSORT Object Detection and Tracking

Project Overview:

The goal of this project is to implement a robust and efficient real-time object detection and tracking system by combining YOLOv4 (You Only Look Once) for object detection and DeepSORT (Deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) for object tracking. This integrated solution will enable accurate and reliable tracking of multiple objects in video streams or surveillance footage.

Key Components:

YOLOv4 Object Detection:

Implement YOLOv4, a state-of-the-art real-time object detection algorithm, to accurately identify and classify objects in each frame of a video stream.
Fine-tune the YOLOv4 model on the specific dataset relevant to the application, ensuring high accuracy and detection performance for the targeted objects.

DeepSORT Object Tracking:

Integrate DeepSORT, a deep learning-based object tracking algorithm, to associate and track detected objects across consecutive frames.
Utilize the learned appearance features and motion information to maintain accurate tracks even in challenging scenarios such as occlusions and object interactions.

Real-Time Processing:

Optimize the overall system for real-time processing, ensuring low-latency performance suitable for live video feeds.
Explore hardware acceleration options (e.g., GPU) to enhance the speed of both object detection and tracking.

Bounding Box Visualization:

Implement a user-friendly interface to visualize the detected objects and their corresponding tracking information.
Display bounding boxes around identified objects with unique IDs for easy tracking visualization.

Post-Processing and Filtering:

Apply post-processing techniques to filter out false positives and improve the overall accuracy of the detection.
Implement thresholding and filtering mechanisms to improve the robustness of the tracking algorithm.

Scalability and Deployment:

Design the system to be scalable for deployment in various scenarios, from surveillance cameras to autonomous vehicles.
Consider options for model compression and optimization for deployment on edge devices.

Expected Outcomes:

Accurate real-time object detection and tracking with YOLOv4 and DeepSORT.
Robust handling of challenging scenarios, such as occlusions and object interactions.
User-friendly visualization of tracked objects in a video stream.
High scalability for deployment in diverse applications.
