# YOLOv4 + DeepSORT Object Detection and Tracking

This repository demonstrates a simple implementation of object detection and tracking using YOLOv4 for object detection and DeepSORT for tracking lung ultrasound signs. This system can be used for real-time tracking of objects in lung ultrasound videos.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- YOLOv4
- DeepSORT
